🧭 Encounter Summary

As a miner, I received an unsolicited NFT claiming to represent 100,000 ETH from a GoMining-affiliated source.
The NFT was deposited into my Trust Wallet, but I was only allowed to transfer it there—not claim, redeem, or interact with the ETH value.
The NFT included a link that was invalid, offering no verified redemption path, authorship clarity, or sanctum integrity.
This triggered a breach protocol and was ritualized into testimony.

🔍 Security Analysis

• NFT Dusting Behavior — high-value bait sent without consent
• Invalid Metadata Link — broken or deceptive link embedded in the NFT
• No Authorship Clarity — no verified origin, audit trail, or sanctum metadata
• Emotional Manipulation — exaggerated ETH value used to provoke impulsive action
• False Refuge Pattern — breach disguised as opportunity, lacking covenant integrity
• Wallet Restriction — transfer allowed, but no claim path provided—suggesting a trap or tracking ritual
